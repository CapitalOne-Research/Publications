| 2025 | [An Automatic Method to Estimate Correctness of RAG](https://aclanthology.org/2025.coling-industry.52/)                                                                                 | In sectors in where data quality is critical, like finance and healthcare, it is crucial to have confidence in not only the outputs generated by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models but also the process followed by the model while arriving at the output. Existing methods, such as hallucination detection and input-output entailment measurements, fail to capture the model's internal state during answer generation. This paper introduces a novel approach to predict the correctness of the generated answer by modeling the model's uncertainty on quantified perturbations of input. Extensive experiments across multiple large language models (LLMs) demonstrate that our approach quantifies RAG robustness by aligning predictions with ground truth with a Avg. Mean Square Error (MSE) 0.002 while offering flexibility for diverse qualitative metrics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | COLING                   |
| 2025 | [MetaMetrics: Calibrating Metrics for Generation Tasks Using Human Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02381)                                                                       | Understanding the quality of a performance evaluation metric is crucial for ensuring that model outputs align with human preferences. However, it remains unclear how well each metric captures the diverse aspects of these preferences, as metrics often excel in one particular area but not across all dimensions. To address this, it is essential to systematically calibrate metrics to specific aspects of human preference, catering to the unique characteristics of each aspect. We introduce MetaMetrics, a calibrated meta-metric designed to evaluate generation tasks across different modalities in a supervised manner. MetaMetrics optimizes the combination of existing metrics to enhance their alignment with human preferences. Our metric demonstrates flexibility and effectiveness in both language and vision downstream tasks, showing significant benefits across various multilingual and multi-domain scenarios. MetaMetrics aligns closely with human preferences and is highly extendable and easily integrable into any application. This makes MetaMetrics a powerful tool for improving the evaluation of generation tasks, ensuring that metrics are more representative of human judgment across diverse contexts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | ICLR                     |

| 2025 | [ProxyLM: Predicting Language Model Performance on Multilingual Tasks via Proxy Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09334)                                                               | Performance prediction is a method to estimate the performance of multilingual language models (LMs), mitigating computational costs associated with model capacity and data for fine-tuning. Our paper introduces ProxyLM, a scalable framework for predicting LM performance using proxy models in multilingual tasks. These proxy models act as surrogates, approximating the performance of fine-tuned LMs on specific downstream natural language processing (NLP) tasks. By leveraging proxy models, ProxyLM significantly reduces computational overhead on task evaluations, achieving up to a 37.08x speedup compared to traditional methods, even with our smallest proxy models. Additionally, our methodology showcases adaptability to previously unseen languages in pre-trained LMs, outperforming the state-of-the-art performance by 1.89x as measured by root-mean-square-error (RMSE). This framework streamlines model selection, enabling efficient deployment and iterative LM enhancements without extensive computational resources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | NAACL                    |
| 2025 | [RainbowPO: A Unified Framework for Combining Improvements in Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04203)                                                                | Recently, numerous preference optimization algorithms have been introduced as extensions to the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) family. While these methods have successfully aligned models with human preferences, there is a lack of understanding regarding the contributions of their additional components. Moreover, fair and consistent comparisons are scarce, making it difficult to discern which components genuinely enhance downstream performance. In this work, we propose RainbowPO, a unified framework that demystifies the effectiveness of existing DPO methods by categorizing their key components into seven broad directions. We integrate these components into a single cohesive objective, enhancing the performance of each individual element. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RainbowPO outperforms existing DPO variants. Additionally, we provide insights to guide researchers in developing new DPO methods and assist practitioners in their implementations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | ICLR                     |

It is paramount to ensure the security and reliability of these products by mitigating their vulnerabilities towards malicious user interactions, which can lead to the exposure of great risks as well as reputational repercussions. In this work, we present a comprehensive study on the efficacy of fine-tuning and aligning Chain-of-Thought (CoT) responses of different LLMs that serve as input moderation guardrails. Our approach involves systematically exploring these tuning methods by leveraging a small set of training data to adapt these models as proxy defense mechanisms to detect malicious inputs and provide a reasoning for their verdicts, thereby preventing the exploitation of conversational agents. We rigorously evaluate the efficacy and robustness of different tuning strategies to generalize across diverse adversarial and malicious query types. Our experimental results outline the potential of alignment processes tailored to a varied range of harmful input queries, even with constrained data resources. These techniques significantly enhance the safety of conversational AI systems and provide a feasible framework for deploying more secure and trustworthy AI-driven interactions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | AAAI                     |

Specifically, APT is pre-trained with adversarial synthetic data agents, who continue to shift their underlying data generating distribution and deliberately challenge the model with different synthetic datasets. In addition, we propose a patch embedding block within the transformer architecture to handle datasets with large number of features, and more importantly, a mixture block architecture that is able to handle classification tasks with arbitrary number of classes, addressing the class size limitations -- a crucial weakness of prior tabular zero-shot learning algorithms. In experiments, we show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on small tabular classification tasks without restrictions on feature size, class size, number of categorical features or number of missing values. We show that on regression tasks, where PFN-based models have not shown great performance, APT has made significant progress over TabPFN. In our analysis, we demonstrate that the adversarial synthetic data agents were able to generate a more diverse collection of data compared to the ordinary random generator in TabPFN, and had accelerated the pre-training process. In ablation study, we present statistics on the contribution of each proposed components above, providing evidence on their respective impact.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | ICML                     |

Modern learning models, while powerful, often exhibit a level of complexity that renders them opaque black boxes, resulting in a notable lack of transparency that hinders our ability to decipher their decision-making processes. Opacity challenges the interpretability and practical application of machine learning, especially in critical domains where understanding the underlying reasons is essential for informed decision-making. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) rises to meet that challenge, unraveling the complexity of black boxes by providing elucidating explanations. Among the various XAI approaches, feature attribution/importance XAI stands out for its capacity to delineate the significance of input features in the prediction process. However, most existing attribution methods have limitations, such as instability, when divergent explanations may result from similar or even the same instance. In this work, we introduce T-Explainer, a novel local additive attribution explainer based on Taylor expansion endowed with desirable properties, such as local accuracy and consistency, while stable over multiple runs. We demonstrate T-Explainer's effectiveness through benchmark experiments with well-known attribution methods. In addition, T-Explainer is developed as a comprehensive XAI framework comprising quantitative metrics to assess and visualize attribution explanations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | IEEE Intelligent Systems |

The disagreement problem is one such issue, as there may be scenarios where the output of different explanation methods disagree with each other. Although understanding how often, when, and where explanation methods agree or disagree is important to increase confidence in the explanations, few works have been dedicated to investigating such a problem. In this work, we proposed Visagreement, a visualization tool designed to assist practitioners in investigating the disagreement problem. Visagreement builds upon metrics to quantitatively compare and evaluate explanations, enabling visual resources to uncover where and why methods mostly agree or disagree. The tool is tailored for tabular data with binary classification and focuses on local feature importance methods. In the provided use cases, Visagreement turned out to be effective in revealing, among other phenomena, how disagreements relate to the quality of the explanations and machine learning model accuracy, thus assisting users in deciding where and when to trust explanations. To assess the effectiveness and practical utility of Visagreement, we conducted an evaluation involving four experts. These experts assessed the tool's Effectiveness, Usability, and Impact on Decision-Making. The experts confirm the Visagreement tool's effectiveness and user-friendliness, making it a valuable asset for analyzing and exploring (dis)agreements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | IEEE TVCG                |

While much research has proposed methods for defending LLM systems against misuse by malicious actors, researchers have recently complemented these efforts with an offensive approach that involves red teaming, i.e., proactively attacking LLMs with the purpose of identifying their vulnerabilities. This paper provides a concise and practical overview of the LLM red teaming literature, structured so as to describe a multi-component system end-to-end. To motivate red teaming we survey the initial safety needs of some high-profile LLMs, and then dive into the different components of a red teaming system as well as software packages for implementing them. We cover various attack methods, strategies for attack-success evaluation, metrics for assessing experiment outcomes, as well as a host of other considerations. Our survey will be useful for any reader who wants to rapidly obtain a grasp of the major red teaming concepts for their own use in practical applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | NAACL                    |

To evaluate their understanding of such knowledge, we introduce WorldCuisines, a massive-scale benchmark for multilingual and multicultural, visually grounded language understanding. This benchmark includes a visual question answering (VQA) dataset with text-image pairs across 30 languages and dialects, spanning 9 language families and featuring over 1 million data points, making it the largest multicultural VQA benchmark to date. It includes tasks for identifying dish names and their origins. We provide evaluation datasets in two sizes (12k and 60k instances) alongside a training dataset (1 million instances). Our findings show that while VLMs perform better with correct location context, they struggle with adversarial contexts and predicting specific regional cuisines and languages. To support future research, we release a knowledge base with annotated food entries and images along with the VQA data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | NAACL                    |

Examples include proteins in PPI networks with multiple functions and users in social or e-commerce networks exhibiting diverse interests. Tackling multi-label node classification (MLNC) on graphs has led to the development of various approaches. Some methods leverage graph neural networks (GNNs) to exploit label co-occurrence correlations, while others incorporate label embeddings to capture label proximity. However, these approaches fail to account for the intricate influences between labels in non-Euclidean graph data. To address this issue, we decompose the message passing process in GNNs into two operations: propagation and transformation. We then conduct a comprehensive analysis and quantification of the influence correlations between labels in each operation. Building on these insights, we propose a novel model, Label Influence Propagation (LIP). Specifically, we construct a label influence graph based on the integrated label correlations. Then, we propagate high-order influences through this graph, dynamically adjusting the learning process by amplifying labels with positive contributions and mitigating those with negative influence. Finally, our framework is evaluated on comprehensive benchmark datasets, consistently outperforming SOTA methods across various settings, demonstrating its effectiveness on MLNC tasks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | ICLR                     |

Systematic Evaluation of the Multifaceted Capabilities of LLMs in Negotiation Dialogues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13550)                             | A successful negotiation requires a range of capabilities, including comprehension of the conversation context, Theory-of-Mind (ToM) skills to infer the partner's motives, strategic reasoning, and effective communication, making it challenging for automated systems. Despite the remarkable performance of LLMs in various NLP tasks, there is no systematic evaluation of their capabilities in negotiation. Such an evaluation is critical for advancing AI negotiation agents and negotiation research, ranging from designing dialogue systems to providing pedagogical feedback and scaling up data collection practices. This work aims to systematically analyze the multifaceted capabilities of LLMs across diverse dialogue scenarios throughout the stages of a typical negotiation interaction. Our analysis highlights GPT-4's superior performance in many tasks while identifying specific challenges, such as making subjective assessments and generating contextually appropriate, strategically advantageous responses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | EMNLP                    |

However, current MoE training approaches only update the router with a sparse gradient and suffer from issues such as load imbalance. We propose a new router that can receive a dense gradient update from a sparse forward pass. Our method adds minimal overhead, but improves on the common Top-K routing in both performance and load balance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | NeurIPS                  |

While such approaches are seemingly robust, we show in this paper that our carefully designed and novel DNS exfiltration attack, Dolos, that uses a generative adversarial network (GAN), can guide the encoding of sensitive data in a manner that both evades these detectors and significantly speeds up the exfiltration rate compared to prior methods. At its core, Dolos divides the exfiltration data into smaller chunks, and projects each chunk into a representation that is very similar to benign queries. In addition, Dolosadaptively tunes its exfiltration rate to conform with benign DNS traffic from the compromised host, and introduces proper levels of spurious traffic to reduce entropy. Importantly, Dolos evades machine learning (ML) based detectors with no prior knowledge of their architectures or training sets (i.e., it is a blackbox exfiltration). We perform extensive evaluations using multiple datasets and also have a real im-plementation of DOLOS. Our evaluations show that DOLOS has a 12% detection probability even if 6 out of the 9 state-of-the-art defenses that we consider, are jointly used to detect exfiltration; if any of today's baseline exfiltration techniques try to achieve the same rate as Dolos in this setting, they are almost surely detected. If we reduce the rates of the baselines to achieve even a low albeit slightly higher detection probability than Dolos (0.15), we see that they take 25 x longer to achieve the exfiltration. With the other three defenses, we find that baselines are almost surely detected while Dolos remains relatively unaffected regardless of the rate of exfiltration. | Europe S&P               |

However, existing approaches to tabular data representation often face limitations, primarily due to their focus on cell-level tasks and the lack of high-quality training data. To address these challenges, we first formulate a clear definition of table similarity in the context of data transformation activities within data-driven enterprises. This definition serves as the foundation for synthetic data generation, which require a well-defined data generation process. Building on this, we propose a novel synthetic data generation pipeline that harnesses the code generation and data manipulation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a large-scale synthetic dataset tailored for table-level representation learning. Through manual validation and performance comparisons on the table recommendation task, we demonstrate that the synthetic data generated by our pipeline aligns with our proposed definition of table similarity and significantly enhances table representations, leading to improved recommendation performance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | NeurIPS                  |

The recent development of Neural Additive Models (NAMs) is a significant step in the direction of interpretable deep learning for tabular datasets. In this paper, we propose a new subclass of NAMs that use a single-layer neural network construction of the Gaussian process via random Fourier features, which we call Gaussian Process Neural Additive Models (GP-NAM). GP-NAMs have the advantage of a convex objective function and number of trainable parameters that grows linearly with feature dimensionality. It suffers no loss in performance compared to deeper NAM approaches because GPs are well-suited for learning complex non-parametric univariate functions. We demonstrate the performance of GP-NAM on several tabular datasets, showing that it achieves comparable or better performance in both classification and regression tasks with a large reduction in the number of parameters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | AAAI                     |

This, along with the scarcity of high-quality parallel retrieval data, limits their performance in retrieval. We introduce LANCER, a multi-task learning framework that improves language-invariant dense retrieval by reducing language-specific signals in the embedding space. Leveraging the notion of linear concept erasure, we design a loss function that penalizes cross-correlation between representations and their language labels. LANCER leverages only English retrieval data and general multilingual corpora, training models to focus on language-invariant retrieval by semantic similarity without necessitating a vast parallel corpus. Experimental results on various datasets show our method consistently improves over baselines, with extensive analyses demonstrating greater language agnosticism.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | EMNLP                    |

We find that these improvements can be tied back to loss deceleration, an abrupt transition in the rate of loss improvement, characterized by piece-wise linear behavior in log-log space. Notably, improvements from increased model size appear to be a result of (1) improving the loss at which this transition occurs; and (2) improving the rate of loss improvement after this transition. As an explanation for the mechanism underlying this transition (and the effect of model size on loss it mediates), we propose the zero-sum learning (ZSL) hypothesis. In ZSL, per-token gradients become systematically opposed, leading to degenerate training dynamics where the model can't improve loss on one token without harming it on another; bottlenecking the overall rate at which loss can improve. We find compelling evidence of ZSL, as well as unexpected results which shed light on other factors contributing to ZSL.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | NeurIPS                  |

However, despite recent advances in multilingual language models (LMs), the effectiveness of these models' representations in semantic retrieval contexts has not been comprehensively explored. To fill this gap, this paper introduces the MINERS, a benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of multilingual LMs in semantic retrieval tasks, including bitext mining and classification via retrieval-augmented contexts. We create a comprehensive framework to assess the robustness of LMs in retrieving samples across over 200 diverse languages, including extremely low-resource languages in challenging cross-lingual and code-switching settings. Our results demonstrate that by solely retrieving semantically similar embeddings yields performance competitive with state-of-the-art approaches, without requiring any fine-tuning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | EMNLP                    |

As a result, a large number of local explainability methods for black-box models have been developed and popularized. However, machine learning explanations are still hard to evaluate and compare due to the high dimensionality, heterogeneous representations, varying scales, and stochastic nature of some of these methods. Topological Data Analysis (TDA) can be an effective method in this domain since it can be used to transform attributions into uniform graph representations, providing a common ground for comparison across different explanation methods. We present a novel topology-driven visual analytics tool, Mountaineer, that allows ML practitioners to interactively analyze and compare these representations by linking the topological graphs back to the original data distribution, model predictions, and feature attributions. Mountaineer facilitates rapid and iterative exploration of ML explanations, enabling experts to gain deeper insights into the explanation techniques, understand the underlying data distributions, and thus reach well-founded conclusions about model behavior. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of Mountaineer through two case studies using real-world data. In the first, we show how Mountaineer enabled us to compare black-box ML explanations and discern regions of and causes of disagreements between different explanations. In the second, we demonstrate how the tool can be used to compare and understand ML models themselves. Finally, we conducted interviews with three industry experts to help us evaluate our work.                                                                                                 | IEEE VIS                 |

This makes it challenging and expensive for model trainers to acquire the data they need to improve model performance. To address this challenge, we propose Mycroft, a data-efficient method that enables model trainers to evaluate the relative utility of different data sources while working with a constrained data-sharing budget. By leveraging feature space distances and gradient matching, Mycroft identifies small but informative data subsets from each owner, allowing model trainers to maximize performance with minimal data exposure. Experimental results across four tasks in two domains show that Mycroft converges rapidly to the performance of the full-information baseline, where all data is shared. Moreover, Mycroft is robust to noise and can effectively rank data owners by utility. Mycroft can pave the way for democratized training of high performance ML models.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | NeurIPS                  |

Despite the complexities of script differences and tokenization, these approaches have been indiscriminately applied to summarization across multiple languages. While previous works have argued that these approaches correlate strongly with human ratings in English, it remains unclear whether the conclusion holds for other languages. To answer this question, we construct a small-scale pilot dataset containing article-summary pairs and human ratings in English, Chinese and Indonesian. To measure the strength of summaries, our ratings are measured as head-to-head comparisons with resulting Elo scores across four dimensions. Our analysis reveals that standard metrics are unreliable measures of quality, and that these problems are exacerbated in Chinese and Indonesian. We advocate for more nuanced and careful considerations in designing a robust evaluation framework for multiple languages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | EMNLP                    |

We may want models to output refusal messages for various categories of user queries, for example, ill-posed questions, instructions for committing illegal acts, or queries which require information past the model's knowledge horizon. Engineering models that refuse to answer such questions is complicated by the fact that an individual may want their model to exhibit varying levels of sensitivity for refusing queries of various categories, and different users may want different refusal rates. The current default approach involves training multiple models with varying proportions of refusal messages from each category to achieve the desired refusal rates, which is computationally expensive and may require training a new model to accommodate each user's desired preference over refusal rates. To address these challenges, we propose refusal tokens, one such token for each refusal category or a single refusal token, which are prepended to the model's responses during training. We then show how to increase or decrease the probability of generating the refusal token for each category during inference to steer the model's refusal behavior. Refusal tokens enable controlling a single model's refusal rates without the need of any further fine-tuning, but only by selectively intervening during generation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | NeurIPS                  |

Time series forecasting shares a similar sequential structure to language, and is amenable to large-scale transformer architectures. Here we show that foundational decoder-only time series transformer models exhibit analogous scaling-behavior to LLMs, with architectural details (aspect ratio and number of heads) having a minimal effect over broad ranges. We assemble a large corpus of heterogenous time series data on which to train, and establish for the first time power-law scaling with parameter count, dataset size, and training compute, spanning five orders of magnitude.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | NeurIPS                  |

Previous efforts focused on a small number of hand-crafted structured matrices and neglected to investigate whether these structures can surpass dense layers in terms of compute-optimal scaling laws when both the model size and training examples are optimally allocated. In this work, we present a unifying framework that enables searching among all linear operators expressible via an Einstein summation. This framework encompasses many previously proposed structures, such as low-rank, Kronecker, Tensor-Train, Block Tensor-Train (BTT), and Monarch, along with many novel structures. To analyze the framework, we develop a taxonomy of all such operators based on their computational and algebraic properties and show that differences in the compute-optimal scaling laws are mostly governed by a small number of variables that we introduce. Namely, a small ω (which measures parameter sharing) and large ψ (which measures the rank) reliably led to better scaling laws. Guided by the insight that full-rank structures that maximize parameters per unit of compute perform the best, we propose BTT-MoE, a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture obtained by sparsifying computation in the BTT structure. In contrast to the standard sparse MoE for each entire feed-forward network, BTT-MoE learns an MoE in every single linear layer of the model, including the projection matrices in the attention blocks. We find BTT-MoE provides a substantial compute-efficiency gain over dense layers and standard MoE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | NeurIPS                  |

While performance improves with more experts, the gains are diminshing whereas memory scales linearly with the number of experts. We introduce StructMoE, a scaling approach for Mixture of Experts which augments experts with additional dynamic capacity using routed structured matrices which we refer to as<br>Low Rank Exprts (LoRE). At a high-level, we introduce hierarchical MoEs where the first level of routing decides which expert each token should be routed to and the second level of routing decides which LoRE should each token be routed through. The outputs of the expert and the LoRE are then entangled together to provide the final output. This introduces more dynamism into the model which has empirically been demonstrated to improve model performance. We find this scaling approach to outperform a standard MoE baseline in terms of loss on a held out validation. Thus, we propose this to be an effective scaling technique for MoEs compared to the standard approach of adding more experts to the model.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | NeurIPS                  |

The resulting interactions are recorded at heterogeneous temporal resolutions across these domains. This multi-channel data can be combined and encoded to create a comprehensive representation of the customer's journey for accurate intent prediction. This demands sequential learning solutions. NMT transformers achieve state-of-the-art sequential representation learning by encoding context and decoding for the next best action to represent long-range dependencies. However, three major challenges exist while combining multi-domain sequences within an encoder-decoder transformers architecture for intent prediction applications: a) aligning sequences with different sampling rates b) learning temporal dynamics across multi-variate, multi-domain sequences c) combining dynamic and static sequences. We propose an encoder-decoder transformer model to address these challenges for contextual and sequential intent prediction in financial servicing applications.

The research assesses the impact of the agent's presence and expressiveness on user satisfaction, technology acceptance, social presence, and emotional intimacy. A comparative user study with 30 participants reveals that the expressive agent significantly improves the viewing experience, as well as the perceived social connection between users and the agent, compared with an inexpressive agent and no agents at all. This paper contributes to VR/AR and human-agent interaction by demonstrating how virtual companions can influence media consumption and foster social connections, particularly for isolated demographics like the elderly or those living alone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | ISMAR                    |

We observe that these models poorly generalize even when trained on a mixture of domains, making them unsuitable to be deployed under diverse real-world setups. We therefore propose a general-purpose, lightweight Domain Disentanglement Module (DDM) that can be plugged into any self-supervised encoder to effectively perform representation learning on multiple, diverse domains with or without shared classes. During pre-training according to a self-supervised loss, DDM enforces a disentanglement in the representation space by splitting it into a domain-variant and a domain-invariant portion. When domain labels are not available, DDM uses a robust clustering approach to discover pseudo-domains. We show that pre-training with DDM can show up to 3.5% improvement in linear probing accuracy on state-of-the-art self-supervised models including SimCLR, MoCo, BYOL, DINO, SimSiam and Barlow Twins on multi-domain benchmarks including PACS, DomainNet and WILDS. Models trained with DDM show significantly improved generalization (7.4%) to unseen domains compared to baselines. Therefore, DDM can efficiently adapt self-supervised encoders to provide high-quality, generalizable representations for diverse multi-domain data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | BMVC                     |

While the literature is abundant in effective detection algorithms due to this practical relevance, autonomous anomaly detection is rarely used in real-world scenarios.

In this work, we introduce ALARM (for Analyst-in-the-Loop Anomaly Reasoning and Management); an end-to-end framework that supports the anomaly mining cycle comprehensively, from detection to action. Besides unsupervised detection of emerging anomalies, it offers anomaly explanations and an interactive GUI for human-in-the-loop processes -- visual exploration, sense-making, and ultimately action-taking via designing new detection rules -- that help close \`\`the loop'' as the new rules complement rule-based supervised detection, typical of many deployed systems in practice.

Meanwhile, existing GNN architectures are limited in their ability to perform equally well on both homophilious and heterophilious graphs as their inductive biases are generally tailored to only one setting. To address these issues, we propose GOAT, a scalable global graph transformer. In GOAT, each node conceptually attends to all the nodes in the graph and homophily/heterophily relationships can be learnt adaptively from the data. We provide theoretical justification for our approximate global self-attention scheme, and show it to be scalable to large-scale graphs. We demonstrate the competitiveness of GOAT on both heterophilious and homophilious graphs with millions of nodes.

For a target feature, FALCON captions its highly activating cropped images using a large captioning dataset (like LAION-400m) and a pre-trained vision-language model like CLIP. Each word among the captions is scored and ranked leading to a small number of shared, human-understandable concepts that closely describe the target feature. FALCON also applies contrastive interpretation using lowly activating (counterfactual) images, to eliminate spurious concepts. Although many existing approaches interpret features independently, we observe in state-of-the-art self-supervised and supervised models, that less than 20% of the representation space can be explained by individual features. We show that features in larger spaces become more interpretable when studied in groups and can be explained with high-order scoring concepts through FALCON. We discuss how extracted concepts can be used to explain and debug failures in downstream tasks. Finally, we present a technique to transfer concepts from one (explainable) representation space to another unseen representation space by learning a simple linear transformation.

In parallel, some have trained a critical lens on the ethics of dataset creation and ML research. In this position paper, we highlight the entanglement of ethics with seemingly \`\`technical'' or \`\`scientific'' decisions about the design of ML benchmarks. Our starting point is the existence of multiple overlooked structural similarities between human intelligence benchmarks and ML benchmarks. Both types of benchmarks set standards for describing, evaluating, and comparing performance on tasks relevant to intelligence -- standards that many scholars of human intelligence have long recognized as value-laden. We use perspectives from feminist philosophy of science on IQ benchmarks and thick concepts in social science to argue that values need to be considered and documented when creating ML benchmarks. It is neither possible nor desirable to avoid this choice by creating value-neutral benchmarks. Finally, we outline practical recommendations for ML benchmark research ethics and ethics review.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | FAccT                    |

The majority of research on training neural networks under class imbalance has focused on specialized loss functions, sampling techniques, or two-stage training procedures. Notably, we demonstrate that simply tuning existing components of standard deep learning pipelines, such as the batch size, data augmentation, optimizer, and label smoothing, can achieve state-of-the-art performance without any such specialized class imbalance methods. We also provide key prescriptions and considerations for training under class imbalance, and an understanding of why imbalance methods succeed or fail.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | NeurIPS                  |

Accuracy aside, a major advantage of neural models is that they learn reusable features and are easily fine-tuned in new domains. This property is often exploited in computer vision and natural language applications, where transfer learning is indispensable when task-specific training data is scarce. In this work, we demonstrate that upstream data gives tabular neural networks a decisive advantage over widely used GBDT models. We propose a realistic medical diagnosis benchmark for tabular transfer learning, and we present a how-to guide for using upstream data to boost performance with a variety of tabular neural network architectures. Finally, we propose a pseudo-feature method for cases where the upstream and downstream feature sets differ, a tabular-specific problem widespread in real-world applications.

This problem is crucial in many fields, such as fintech and the healthcare industry, where accurate decisions and their justifications are equally important. Many studies have leveraged the power of deep generative models for counterfactual generation. However, most focus on vision data and leave the latent space unsupervised. In this paper, we propose a new and general framework that uses a supervised extension to the Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) with Normalizing Flow (NF) for simultaneous classification and counterfactual generation. We show experiments on two tabular financial data-sets, Lending Club (LCD) and Give Me Some Credit (GMC), which show that the model can achieve a state-of-art level prediction accuracy while also producing meaningful counterfactual examples to interpret and justify the classifier's decision.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | ICAIF                    |

In its place, method developers have relied on axioms to determine desirable properties for their explanations' behavior. For high stakes uses of machine learning that require explainability, it is not sufficient to rely on axioms as the implementation, or its usage, can fail to live up to the ideal. As a result, there exists active research on validating the performance of XAI methods. The need for validation is especially magnified in domains with a reliance on XAI. A procedure frequently used to assess their utility, and to some extent their fidelity, is an ablation study. By perturbing the input variables in rank order of importance, the goal is to assess the sensitivity of the model's performance. Perturbing important variables should correlate with larger decreases in measures of model capability than perturbing less important features. While the intent is clear, the actual implementation details have not been studied rigorously for tabular data. Using five datasets, three XAI methods, four baselines, and three perturbations, we aim to show 1) how varying perturbations and adding simple guardrails can help to avoid potentially flawed conclusions, 2) how treatment of categorical variables is an important consideration in both post-hoc explainability and ablation studies, and 3) how to identify useful baselines for XAI methods and viable perturbations for ablation studies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | KDD                      |

While practitioners often use count-based metrics derived from confusion matrices, like accuracy, many applications, such as weather prediction, sports betting, or patient risk prediction, rely on a classifier's predicted probabilities rather than predicted labels. In these instances, practitioners are concerned with producing a calibrated model, that is, one which outputs probabilities that reflect those of the true distribution. Model calibration is often analyzed visually, through static reliability diagrams, however, the traditional calibration visualization may suffer from a variety of drawbacks due to the strong aggregations it necessitates. Furthermore, count-based approaches are unable to sufficiently analyze model calibration. We present Calibrate, an interactive reliability diagram that addresses the aforementioned issues. Calibrate constructs a reliability diagram that is resistant to drawbacks in traditional approaches, and allows for interactive subgroup analysis and instance-level inspection. We demonstrate the utility of Calibrate through use cases on both real-world and synthetic data. We further validate Calibrate by presenting the results of a think-aloud experiment with data scientists who routinely analyze model calibration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | IEEE                     |

Classical approaches to solving tabular problems, such as gradient boosting and random forests, are widely used by practitioners. However, recent deep learning methods have achieved a degree of performance competitive with popular techniques. We devise a hybrid deep learning approach to solving tabular data problems. Our method, SAINT, performs attention over both rows and columns, and it includes an enhanced embedding method. We also study a new contrastive self-supervised pre-training method for use when labels are scarce. SAINT consistently improves performance over previous deep learning methods, and it even outperforms gradient boosting methods, including XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM, on average over a variety of benchmark tasks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | NeurIPS                  |

While current model interpretation methodologies focus on using locally linear functions to approximate the models or creating self-explanatory models that give explanations to each input instance, they do not focus on model interpretation at the subpopulation level, which is the understanding of model interpretations across different subset aggregations in a dataset. To address the challenges of providing explanations of an ML model across the whole dataset, we propose SUBPLEX, a visual analytics system to help users understand black-box model explanations with subpopulation visual analysis. SUBPLEX is designed through an iterative design process with machine learning researchers to address three usage scenarios of real-life machine learning tasks: model debugging, feature selection, and bias detection. The system applies novel subpopulation analysis on ML model explanations and interactive visualization to explore the explanations on a dataset with different levels of granularity. Based on the system, we conduct user evaluation to assess how understanding the interpretation at a subpopulation level influences the sense-making process of interpreting ML models from a user's perspective. Our results suggest that by providing model explanations for different groups of data, SUBPLEX encourages users to generate more ingenious ideas to enrich the interpretations.

However, comparing local explainability methods is difficult since they each generate outputs in various scales and dimensions. Furthermore, due to the stochastic nature of some explainability methods, it is possible for different runs of a method to produce contradictory explanations for a given observation. In this paper, we propose a topology-based framework to extract a simplified representation from a set of local explanations. We do so by first modeling the relationship between the explanation space and the model predictions as a scalar function. Then, we compute the topological skeleton of this function. This topological skeleton acts as a signature for such functions, which we use to compare different explanation methods. We demonstrate that our framework can not only reliably identify differences between explainability techniques but also provides stable representations. Then, we show how our framework can be used to identify appropriate parameters for local explainability methods. Our framework is simple, does not require complex optimizations, and can be broadly applied to most local explanation methods. We believe the practicality and versatility of our approach will help promote topology-based approaches as a tool for understanding and comparing explanation methods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | ICML                     |

Among many existing explainable analyses, counterfactual generation has become widely used for understanding neural networks and making tailored recommendations. However, few studies are devoted to providing quantitative measures for evaluating counterfactuals. In this paper, we propose a quantitative approach based on maximum mean discrepancy (MMD). We employ several existing counterfactual methods to demonstrate this proposed method on the MNIST image data set and two tabular financial data sets, Lending Club (LCD) and Give Me Some Credit (GMC). The results demonstrate the potential usefulness as well as the simplicity of the proposed method.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | ICAIF                    |
| 2022 | [Visual Exploration of Machine Learning Model Behavior with Hierarchical Surrogate Rule Sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07724)                                                         | One of the potential solutions for model interpretation is to train a surrogate model: a more transparent model that approximates the behavior of the model to be explained. Typically, classification rules or decision trees are used due to the intelligibility of their logic-based expressions. However, decision trees can grow too deep and rule sets can become too large to approximate a complex model. Unlike paths on a decision tree that must share ancestor nodes (conditions), rules are more flexible. However, the unstructured visual representation of rules makes it hard to make inferences across rules. To address these issues, we present a workflow that includes novel algorithmic and interactive solutions. First, we present Hierarchical Surrogate Rules (HSR), an algorithm that generates hierarchical rules based on user-defined parameters. We also contribute SuRE, a visual analytics (VA) system that integrates HSR and interactive surrogate rule visualizations. Particularly, we present a novel feature-aligned tree to overcome the shortcomings of existing rule visualizations. We evaluate the algorithm in terms of parameter sensitivity, time performance, and comparison with surrogate decision trees and find that it scales reasonably well and outperforms decision trees in many respects. We also evaluate the visualization and the VA system by a usability study with 24 volunteers and an observational study with 7 domain experts. Our investigation shows that the participants can use feature-aligned trees to perform non-trivial tasks with very high accuracy. We also discuss many interesting observations that can be useful for future research on designing effective rule-based VA systems.                                                                                                                                                               | IEEE                     |

We propose Dynamic Customer Embeddings (DCE), a framework that leverages customers' digital activity and a wide range of financial context to learn dense representations of customers in the FS industry. Our method examines customer actions and pageviews within a mobile or web digital session, the sequencing of the sessions themselves, and snapshots of common financial features across our organization at the time of login. We test our customer embeddings using real world data in three prediction problems: 1) the intent of a customer in their next digital session, 2) the probability of a customer calling the call centers after a session, and 3) the probability of a digital session to be fraudulent. DCE showed performance lift in all three downstream problems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | ICML                     |

However, the application of sensitive entity detection for production systems in financial institutions has not been well explored due to the lack of publicly available, labeled datasets. In this paper, we use internal and synthetic datasets to evaluate various methods of detecting NPI (Nonpublic Personally Identifiable) information commonly found within financial institutions, in both unstructured and structured data formats. Character-level neural network models including CNN, LSTM, BiLSTM-CRF, and CNN-CRF are investigated on two prediction tasks: (i) entity detection on multiple data formats, and (ii) column-wise entity prediction on tabular datasets. We compare these models with other standard approaches on both real and synthetic data, with respect to F1-score, precision, recall, and throughput. The real datasets include internal structured data and public email data with manually tagged labels. Our experimental results show that the CNN model is simple yet effective with respect to accuracy and throughput and thus, is the most suitable candidate model to be deployed in the production environment(s). Finally, we provide several lessons learned on data limitations, data labelling and the intrinsic overlap of data entities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | AAAI                     |

High quality explanations are the first step in assessing fairness. Counterfactuals are valuable tools for explainability. They provide actionable, comprehensible explanations for the individual who is subject to decisions made from the prediction. It is important to find a baseline for producing them. We propose a simple method for generating counterfactuals by using gradient descent to search in the latent space of an autoencoder and benchmark our method against approaches that search for counterfactuals in feature space. Additionally, we implement metrics to concretely evaluate the quality of the counterfactuals. We show that latent space counterfactual generation strikes a balance between the speed of basic feature gradient descent methods and the sparseness and authenticity of counterfactuals generated by more complex feature space oriented techniques.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | NeurIPS                  |

But machine learning efforts in FS often fail to account for the temporal richness of these data, even in cases where domain knowledge suggests that the precise temporal patterns between events should contain valuable information. At best, such data are often treated as uniform time series, where there is a sequence but no sense of exact timing. At worst, rough aggregate features are computed over a pre-selected window so that static sample-based approaches can be applied (e.g. number of open lines of credit in the previous year or maximum credit utilization over the previous month). Such approaches are at odds with the deep learning paradigm which advocates for building models that act directly on raw or lightly processed data and for leveraging modern optimization techniques to discover optimal feature transformations en route to solving the modeling task at hand. Furthermore, a full picture of the entity being modeled (customer, company, etc.) might only be attainable by examining multiple data streams that unfold across potentially vastly different time scales. In this paper, we examine the different types of temporal data found in common FS use cases, review the current machine learning approaches in this area, and finally assess challenges and opportunities for researchers working at the intersection of machine learning for temporal data and applications in FS.                                                                                                                                                                                                               | KDD                      |

They also do not account for group-level effects when multiple sequences are observed generated from separate sources. A simple example is user purchasing behavior, where each user generates a unique sequence of purchases, and the time between purchases is variable. We propose a model for such sequential data based on the RNN that accounts for varying time intervals between observations in a sequence. We do this by learning a group-level "base" parameter to which each data-generating object can revert as more time passes before the next observation. This requires modeling assumptions about the data that we argue are typically satisfied by consumer purchasing behavior. Our approach is motivated by the mixed membership framework, with Latent Dirichlet Allocation being the canonical example, which we adapt to our dynamic setting. We demonstrate our approach on two consumer shopping datasets: The Instacart set of 3.4 million online grocery orders made by 206K customers, and a UK retail set consisting of over 500K orders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | ICAIF                    |

We proceed to perform a rigorous qualitative analysis of the latent trajectories to extract real world insights from the proposed representations and their evolution over time that is to our knowledge the first of its kind in the financial sector. Shifts in the latent space are associated with known economic events and in particular the impact of the recent Covid-19 pandemic to consumer patterns. Capturing such patterns indicates the value added to financial modeling through the incorporation of latent graph representations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | ICML                     |

Current approaches including shallow embeddings and Graph Neural Networks have mostly been tested with node classification and link prediction tasks. In this work, we provide an application oriented perspective to a set of popular embedding approaches and evaluate their representational power with respect to real-world graph properties. We implement an extensive empirical data-driven framework to challenge existing norms regarding the expressive power of embedding approaches in graphs with varying patterns along with a theoretical analysis of the limitations we discovered in this process. Our results suggest that "one-to-fit-all" GRL approaches are hard to define in real-world scenarios and as new methods are being introduced they should be explicit about their ability to capture graph properties and their applicability in datasets with non-trivial structural differences.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | ICMLA                    |

Our current interest in synthetic data comes from recent work in explainability. Today's datasets are typically larger and more complex - requiring less interpretable models. In the setting of \\textit{post hoc} explainability, there is no ground truth for explanations. Inspired by recent work in explaining image classifiers that does provide ground truth, we propose a similar solution for tabular data. Using copulas, a concise specification of the desired statistical properties of a dataset, users can build intuition around explainability using controlled data sets and experimentation. The current capabilities are demonstrated on three use cases: one dimensional logistic regression, impact of correlation from informative features, impact of correlation from redundant variables.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | ICML                     |

For financial institutions, such a graph is likely large (with millions or billions of edges) while also sparsely connected. It becomes challenging to apply machine learning to such large and sparse graphs. Graph representation learning seeks to embed the nodes of a graph into a euclidean vector space such that graph topological properties are preserved after the transformation. In this paper, we present a novel application of representation learning to bipartite graphs of credit card transactions in order to learn embeddings of account and merchant entities. Our framework is inspired by popular approaches in graph embeddings and is trained on two internal transaction datasets. This approach yields highly effective embeddings, as quantified by link prediction AUC and F1 score. Further, the resulting entity vectors retain intuitive semantic similarity that is explored through visualizations and other qualitative analyses. Finally, we show how these embeddings can be used as features in downstream machine learning business applications such as fraud detection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | ICMLA                    |

While local explanation methods exist for one prediction, most global attributions still reduce neural network decisions to a single set of features. In response, we present an approach for generating global attributions called GAM, which explains the landscape of neural network predictions across subpopulations. GAM augments global explanations with the proportion of samples that each attribution best explains and specifies which samples are described by each attribution. Global explanations also have tunable granularity to detect more or fewer subpopulations. We demonstrate that GAM's global explanations 1) yield the known feature importances of simulated data, 2) match feature weights of interpretable statistical models on real data, and 3) are intuitive to practitioners through user studies. With more transparent predictions, GAM can help ensure neural network decisions are generated for the right reasons.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | AAAI                     |

Training these algorithms at scale is important for creating embeddings that can be used for classification, ranking, recommendation and other common applications in industry. While industrial systems exist for training graph embeddings on large datasets, many of these distributed architectures are forced to partition copious amounts of data and model logic across many worker nodes. In this paper, we propose a distributed infrastructure that completely avoids graph partitioning, dynamically creates size constrained computational graphs across worker nodes, and uses highly efficient indexing operations for updating embeddings that allow the system to function at scale. We show that our system can scale an existing embeddings algorithm - skip-gram - to train on the open-source Friendster network (68 million vertices) and on an internal heterogeneous graph (50 million vertices). We measure the performance of our system on two key quantitative metrics: link-prediction accuracy and rate of convergence. We conclude this work by analyzing how a greater number of worker nodes actually improves our system's performance on the aforementioned metrics and discuss our next steps for rigorously evaluating the embedding vectors produced by our system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | KDD                      |

We conduct various evaluations of the tools on many datasets, in different data segments, to examine their performance, and compare their advantages and disadvantages on different test cases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | ICTAI                    |
